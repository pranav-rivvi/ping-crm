## 👥 User Management - How It Works

### No Traditional User Accounts Needed!

**Ping CRM uses a "Bring Your Own Keys" model:**

### How Multiple Users Work:

#### Option 1: Shared App, Individual Keys (Recommended)

**Setup:**
1. You deploy the app once: `https://ping-crm.streamlit.app`
2. Share this URL with your friend
3. They go to the app
4. They add THEIR OWN API keys in the app settings

**Result:**
- ✅ Same app URL for everyone
- ✅ Each person's data goes to THEIR Notion
- ✅ Each person uses THEIR Apollo subscription
- ✅ Complete data isolation
- ✅ No user accounts to manage

**Example:**
```
You:
- URL: https://ping-crm.streamlit.app
- Keys: Your Apollo + Your Notion
- Data: Goes to YOUR Notion workspace

Your Friend:
- URL: https://ping-crm.streamlit.app (same!)
- Keys: Their Apollo + Their Notion
- Data: Goes to THEIR Notion workspace

= Two users, zero configuration!
```

#### Option 2: Private App (More Secure)

**Setup:**
1. Deploy app
2. In Streamlit settings → **Make app private**
3. **Invite users by email**:
   - pranav@company.com
   - friend@company.com
4. They get invite email
5. They sign in with GitHub/Google/Email

**Result:**
- ✅ Only invited people can access
- ✅ Email-based authentication (built-in)
- ✅ Still use their own API keys
- ✅ Better for enterprise/teams

#### Option 3: Each Person Deploys Their Own (Ultimate Privacy)

**Setup:**
1. Friend forks your GitHub repo
2. Friend deploys to their Streamlit Cloud
3. Friend gets their own URL: `https://friend-crm.streamlit.app`
4. Friend adds their API keys

**Result:**
- ✅ Completely separate instances
- ✅ Full control over their deployment
- ✅ Can customize the app
- ✅ Best for privacy-sensitive orgs

5. **Paste this** (with YOUR keys):

NOTION_TOKEN = "secret_your_notion_token"
NOTION_DB_ID = "your_database_id"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your_openai_key"
```

6. **Click "Save"**
7. **Reload the app**

### Method 2: Via .streamlit/secrets.toml (Local Development)
