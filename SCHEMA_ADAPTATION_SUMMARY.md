# Schema Adaptation Summary

## Overview

Successfully adapted the CRM enrichment system to work with your existing **contact-centric** Notion database instead of creating a new company-centric database.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Schema Analysis

**Your Existing Database Schema:**
- **Database Name**: HLTH Conference Outreach Tracker
- **Primary Entity**: Individual contacts/people
- **Title Field**: "Contact Name" (person's name)
- **Company Field**: "Company" (text field)

**Existing Fields:**
- Contact Name (title)
- Company (rich_text)
- Email (email)
- Phone (phone_number)
- LinkedIn (url)
- Title (rich_text) - job title
- Industry (select)
- Outreach Status (status)
- Meeting Date/Time (date)
- Meeting Location (rich_text)
- Relationship Type (select)
- Notes (rich_text)

### 2. Code Adaptation

**Created**: `src/notion_sync_adapted.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **Creates one page per contact** instead of one page per company
- Maps to your existing field structure
- Stores enrichment data (tier, priority, company info) in the **Notes** field
- Handles duplicate detection by contact name + company name

**Field Mapping:**
| Apollo Data | Your Notion Field | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Contact name | Contact Name (title) | âœ“ Main identifier |
| Company name | Company (text) | âœ“ From company_data |
| Contact email | Email | âœ“ If available |
| Contact phone | Phone | âœ“ If available |
| LinkedIn URL | LinkedIn | âœ“ Contact LinkedIn |
| Job title | Title | âœ“ Contact's position |
| Industry | Industry | âœ“ Mapped to your options |
| - | Outreach Status | Set to "Not started" |
| Enrichment data | Notes | Tier, priority, company details |

**Industry Mapping:**
Apollo industries are intelligently mapped to your existing options:
- Insurance/Payer â†’ "Insurance"
- Hospital/Health System â†’ "Hospital & Health Systems"
- Pharma â†’ "Pharma"
- Biotech â†’ "Biotech"
- Medical Devices â†’ "Medical Devices"
- Digital Health/Health Tech â†’ "Digital Health"
- Telehealth â†’ "Telehealth"
- Health Services â†’ "Health Services"
- Default â†’ "Healthcare Tech"

### 3. Updated Files

**Modified:**
- `scripts/enrich.py` - Now imports `notion_sync_adapted` and uses `create_contact_pages()`

**Created:**
- `src/notion_sync_adapted.py` - Adapted Notion client
- `scripts/inspect_notion_db.py` - Database schema inspector
- `scripts/test_enrichment.py` - End-to-end enrichment tester

**Original files preserved:**
- `src/notion_sync.py` - Original company-centric version (kept for reference)

---

## How It Works Now

### Enrichment Flow

1. **Search Company** in Apollo.io
   - Get company profile (industry, size, revenue, location, etc.)

2. **Find Decision Makers**
   - Search for relevant job titles based on industry
   - Get up to 10 contacts per company

3. **Calculate Metrics**
   - Assign tier (1-4) based on industry and company profile
   - Calculate priority score (1-10) based on size, revenue, contacts

4. **Sync to Notion**
   - Create **one page per contact** (not per company)
   - Fill in: Contact Name, Company, Email, Phone, LinkedIn, Title, Industry
   - Set "Outreach Status" to "Not started"
   - Add enrichment data to "Notes" field

### Example Result

For company "UnitedHealth Group":
- **5 contacts found** â†’ **5 new pages created**
- Each page has:
  - Contact Name: "Laura Karkula"
  - Company: "UnitedHealth Group"
  - Title: "Vice President, Population Health"
  - Industry: "Hospital & Health Systems"
  - Outreach Status: "Not started"
  - Notes: Contains tier, priority, company size, revenue, location, etc.

## How to Use

### 1. Test with Single Company

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/test_enrichment.py "UnitedHealth Group"
```

This will:
- Search Apollo for the company
- Find decision makers
- Show preview of contacts
- Ask for confirmation before syncing
- Create pages in Notion

### 2. Enrich Multiple Companies

**Step 1**: Create `companies.csv`
```csv
company_name
UnitedHealth Group
CVS Health
Anthem
Cigna
Humana
```

**Step 2**: Run enrichment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/enrich.py companies.csv
```

The script will:
- Process each company
- Find 5-10 decision makers per company
- Create contact pages in Notion
- Show progress and summary

### 3. Inspect Database Schema

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/inspect_notion_db.py
```

Shows:
- All database properties
- Property types
- Select field options
- Validation against code expectations

## Important Notes

### Apollo Email Access

Apollo shows `email_not_unlocked@domain.com` for emails you haven't unlocked with credits.

**Options:**
1. **Use LinkedIn URLs** - Reach out via LinkedIn (no credits needed)
2. **Unlock emails in Apollo** - When you need to email someone
3. **Upgrade Apollo plan** - For more email credits

The contacts are still valuable even without emails!

### Duplicate Prevention

The system checks before creating pages:
- Looks for existing contact name + company combination
- Skips if already exists
- You can safely re-run enrichment without creating duplicates

### Rate Limiting

Built-in rate limiting to respect API limits:
- 1.5 second delay between companies
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful error handling

## Next Steps

### Ready to Use

1. **Create your company list**: `companies.csv` with target companies
2. **Run enrichment**: `python scripts/enrich.py companies.csv`
3. **Review in Notion**: Check your database for new contacts
4. **Start outreach**: Use Outreach Status to track progress

### Optional Enhancements

**Add to Notion** (if desired):
- Tier field (select) - for filtering by tier
- Priority Score field (number) - for sorting
- Company Website field (url) - quick access
- Company Size field (select) - for filtering

Currently these are in the Notes field, but you can add dedicated fields if you want to filter/sort by them.

- Automatic LinkedIn URL scraping
- Meeting scheduler integration
- Email template generator
- Follow-up reminders
- Analytics dashboard

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Apollo.io Authentication âœ…
**Problem**: API returned 422 error
**Cause**: Apollo changed to header-based auth
**Fix**: Added `X-Api-Key` header, removed from request body
**Status**: RESOLVED

### 2. Notion Schema Mismatch âœ…
**Problem**: Code expected company-centric, database is contact-centric
**Cause**: Different use case assumptions
**Fix**: Created adapted client for existing schema
**Status**: RESOLVED

### 3. .env File Format âœ…
**Problem**: API keys had quotes
**Cause**: User added quotes (not needed)
**Fix**: Removed quotes from all keys
**Status**: RESOLVED
