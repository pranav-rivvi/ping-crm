# HLTH 2025 CRM - Executive Breakdown

## The Reality Check

**Your doc describes**: A production-grade system (3-5 days build time)
**You said**: "Fast personal use today"

These are different scopes. Let's clarify:

---

## OPTION A: Full System (What's in your plan)
**Time**: 3-5 days
**Complexity**: High
**Features**: Everything (Apollo API, web scraping, news, auto-tier, Notion sync, SQLite cache)
**Cost**: Apollo API ($$$), SerpAPI ($$), dev time
**Output**: Production-ready enrichment pipeline

---

## OPTION B: Fast MVP (Get working TODAY)
**Time**: 2-4 hours
**Complexity**: Low
**Features**: Core only - CSV input → Apollo API → Notion sync
**Cost**: Apollo API only ($), minimal dev time
**Output**: Functional tracker you can use at HLTH Vegas

---

## What You Actually Need for HLTH Vegas

Based on your doc, you need to:
1. Import list of companies (CSV)
2. Get contact info (Apollo.io)
3. Track outreach in Notion
4. Have this working ASAP

**Recommendation**: Start with **OPTION B** (MVP), then enhance later if needed.

---

## MVP Architecture (2-4 hours)

```
CSV Companies → Python Script → Apollo API → Notion Database
                                    ↓
                            (cache to avoid re-enriching)
```

**What you get**:
- Company name, domain, industry, size
- 3-5 decision-maker contacts with emails
- Auto-sync to Notion
- Basic tier assignment
- Priority scoring

**What you DON'T get** (but can add later):
- Web scraping
- News scraping
- LinkedIn finder (SerpAPI)
- Full SQLite caching layer
- Complex CLI with progress bars

---

## MVP Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (30 min)
1. Create virtual environment
2. Install minimal dependencies (notion-client, requests, pandas, python-dotenv)
3. Setup .env with API keys (Apollo + Notion)
4. Create basic Notion database

### Phase 2: Core Script (60 min)
1. CSV reader
2. Apollo API client (company search + people search)
3. Basic data transformation
4. Notion sync function

### Phase 3: Processing (30 min)
1. Simple tier assignment (keyword matching)
2. Basic priority scoring
3. Error handling

### Phase 4: Testing (30 min)
1. Test on 5 companies
2. Fix bugs
3. Run on full list

**Total**: ~2-3 hours to working system

---

## Decision Time

**Which do you want?**

A. **Full system** (3-5 days) - Everything in your doc
B. **MVP** (2-4 hours) - Working tracker today, enhance later
C. **Hybrid** - MVP today, then add features over next few days

**My recommendation as 100x engineer**: Start with **B (MVP)**, use it at HLTH Vegas, then enhance based on what you actually need in the field.

## What I'll Build for MVP

If you choose MVP, here's what I'll create:

```
HLTH2025_CRM/
├── .env                    # API keys
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt        # Minimal deps
├── companies.csv           # Your input (you provide)
├── enrich.py              # Main script (I build)
└── README.md              # Usage instructions
```

**Usage**:
```bash
python enrich.py companies.csv
```

**Output**: All companies enriched and synced to Notion in ~5-10 mins (depending on list size)

Tell me which option you want and I'll start building immediately.
