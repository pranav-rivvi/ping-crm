## How It Works

### AI Analyzes:
1. **Person's Role**: Title, seniority level
2. **Company Context**: Industry, size, location
3. **Your Goal**: The outreach description you entered
4. **Best Approach**: Value prop, talking points, hooks

### AI Generates:
A **2-3 sentence actionable note** with:
- ✅ Why this person is relevant
- ✅ What value proposition to lead with
- ✅ Specific talking point or hook

### Result:
Your sales team gets **instant context** without reading through all the data!

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: CFO at Healthcare Company
**User Goal**: "Partnership discussions for value-based care solutions"

**AI Note**:
> "As CFO at Humana, this contact controls budget decisions for
> healthcare technology partnerships. Emphasize ROI and cost
> savings from value-based care models. Strong hook: Humana's
> focus on Medicare Advantage aligns with your solution's outcomes
> tracking capabilities."

### Example 2: CTO at Health Tech Startup
**User Goal**: "Technology decision-makers for API integration"

**AI Note**:
> "The CTO role indicates direct authority over technical
> partnerships and integrations. Lead with ease of API integration
> and developer experience. Talking point: Their recent Series B
> funding suggests they're scaling infrastructure—perfect timing
> for your solution."

### Example 3: VP Operations at Hospital System
**User Goal**: "Operations leaders focused on patient outcomes"

**AI Note**:
> "VP of Operations at a 5,000+ employee health system means
> influence over patient care workflows. Frame your solution
> around operational efficiency and improved patient outcomes.
> Hook: Large health systems like theirs are prime candidates for
> HLTH 2025 innovation partnerships."

---

## Troubleshooting

### No AI Notes Appearing?

2. Did you enter an outreach description?
3. Was company data found in Apollo?

**Still not working?**
- Notes will still be created (just without AI section)
- Check terminal for "AI note generation failed" message

### AI Notes Are Generic?
- Try being more specific in your outreach goal
- Include your value proposition or industry
- Mention the type of partnership/discussion

### Want to Disable AI Notes?
- Remove API keys from `.env`
- Notes will fall back to standard format

## Cost Analysis

### Per Contact:
- **API Call**: 1 request
- **Tokens**: ~150-200 tokens
- **Cost (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)**: $0.0001 (0.01 cent)
- **Cost (Gemini 1.5 Flash)**: Free (within limits)

### At Scale:
- **100 contacts**: ~$0.01 (1 cent)
- **1,000 contacts**: ~$0.10 (10 cents)
- **10,000 contacts**: ~$1.00 (1 dollar)

**ROI**: If even 1 additional meeting is booked from better targeting, this pays for itself 1000x over!
